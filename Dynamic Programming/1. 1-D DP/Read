How To Identify Problem That this problem is DP problem 

//Whenever the questions says  -     1.Count the total no. of ways
                                     2.Sometime there are multiple ways of doing something the find Minimum or maximum
                                     
Generally in this kind of questions whe have to apply recursion, But why???????
because when we say 'distinct ways' that means how many ways are there means we have to try "All possible ways"

//Recursion --> Try All Possible Ways 
                      /    \
                     /      \
                    /        \
                 Count      maximum
               total no.      or
               ways         minimum
  
  Now Step first should be the find this problem is recursive or not then we need to think Dp
  
  //Example:- Climbing Stairs
            You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
            Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
            
      n = 3
          1 step + 1 step + 1 step   ------> 1st way
          1 step + 2 step            ------> 2nd way
          2 step + 1 step            ------> 3rd way

we can see that for climbing from 0th stair to nth stair there are total 3 ways that means we need to try all Possible ways to reach to nth stair

SHORTCUT TRICK :- 
Step 1 :- Try to Represent in term of index
Step 2 :- Do all the possible stuff in that index According to the problem statement
Step 3 :- if questions syas --> count (count all stuff)
                            --> best ways (minimum or maximum)
                            
 Example :- in climbing stair questions we have seen that this problem is recursive in nature

Step 1:- we can represent stairs as index that means 0 stair is 0th index , 1st stairis 1st index and so on.....
               stair - 0  1  2  3  4......n
               index - 0  1  2  3  4......index
               
f(index) --> this function will give me the no. of ways to reach from '0' to 'index'

step 2:- at that index we have two options either take one jump or two jump 
that means consider we are at 4th stair means index = 4
how can we reach to that stair either from 3rd stair(1 jump) or 2nd stair(2 jump)

      one way = f(index-1)
      second way = f(index-2)
step 3:- count total no. of ways 
          ans = f(index-1) + f(index-2)
          
 //Base Case :- if index==0 there is only one way(stand)
                if index==1 we have only one way i.e. by jumping from 0th stair
